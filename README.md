# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
For this analysis, I utilized statistical testing methods in RStudio for an AutosRUs new prototype, the MechaCar. In order to continue with the manufacturing of this car, the team required a breakdown of the production data for better insights on how to move forward, to be best prepared against competing producers. 

Summary of the work includes:
- Performed linear regression analysis to identify the predictive variables for the mpg of the MechaCar 
- Collected summary statistics on the Pounds Per Square Inch (PSI) of the suspension coils 
- Utilized t-tests against the manufacturing lots and mean population
- Designed a statistical study comparing MechaCar performance against other vehicles
